# qinit

I decided to learn rust. So I decided to make a linux distribution in it to learn. This is it.

All of this code is probably terrible. As I say, I'm only learning. Lots of mistakes and non idiomatic things 
can be found within. There's probably not even a consistant style, as I find new ways of doing things. 
Basically, take all this code with a grain of salt.
