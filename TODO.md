# ToDos:

Things that I should probably implement at some point - ideas that I've had that I haven't gotten around to

 - Validation tokens - QInit should issue tokens to each service somehow (Kernel Key Service?) which they can then use to communicate with other services. Effectively mTLS, with certificates signed by QInit
 - Networking Daemon
 - PAM Modules for authentication
 - SSH Implementation
 - Some sort of cURL ish thing
 - Socket Activation for Services
 - Maybe a GUI toolkit?
 - Audio Mixer
 -
